# API Management

This set of labs covers the following Oracle Integration Services –

- **Apiary** – for API Design
- **Oracle Integration Cloud** – for Application Integration
- **API Platform** CS – for API Management

The use case is very simple – we need to be able to expose an API that allows us to create new organizations in **Oracle Service Cloud** (aka. Right Now).

We will start by shaping the API in Apiary, then implementing the API in OIC by putting in place a simple logic: checking first if the organization already exists or not in Oracle Service Cloud. We will conclude by exposing the API via API Platform and enforcing some traffic and security policies.
